# BlenderCompat
Windows 7 support for Blender 3.0.x

## Description

This repository contains a compatibility DLL for running Blender 3.0 on Windows 7 and a patch to modify the Blender source to use it. It does this by prepending `bcompat7` to the list of libraries so it uses the entry points in it instead of those in the system libraries.

## Binaries

Stable releases, compiled from the same commit as the official releases, are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/nalexandru/BlenderCompat/releases) page.

More recent builds, including pre-release versions, are provided by Loriem: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/eufffe60fvtr9mz/AAA0YtogOoJTKggWtgAXRyXJa?dl=0

## Building Blender for Windows 7

Build Blender following these instructions: https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Windows with a small change.
Before running `make update`, copy `bcompat7.patch` into the blender source tree and run `git apply bcompat7.patch` then continue with the guide, i.e.:

* Open up Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019
* `cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents`
* `git clone git://git.blender.org/blender.git`
* `cd blender`
* `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kiyos/BlenderCompat/master/bcompat7.patch`
* `git apply bcompat7.patch`
* `make update`
* `make`

To use the your own build of this compatibility DLL, overwrite the files in the `lib/win64_vc15/bcompat7` directory created after running `make update`.

## api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll

In addition to this DLL, `api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll` is required to run Blender because of Python. A version of this library for Windows 7 can be found here: https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK
